# GRCNN

IN DEVELOPMENT

The purpose of this repository is to create a method for users of the Gridcoin crypto-currency (www.gridcoin.us)
to re-distribute the GRC currency to other members who are active on specific BOINC projects, this methodology is
called 'rain' or 'raining'.

This allows for example a project administrator to rain additional GRC funds onto their project if they need a
short term boost in processing power, or between community members as a thankyou, or to bring resources to bear
in preparation for BOINC contests, such as the BOINC Pentathlon (https://www.seti-germany.de/boinc_pentathlon/start.php?&lang=en)

To operate this Python script the Windows Gridcoin Qt wallet must be started with the -server argument to allow the 
gridcoinresearchd to accept the RPC commands.
